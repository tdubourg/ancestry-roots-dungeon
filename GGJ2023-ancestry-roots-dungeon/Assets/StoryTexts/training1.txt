Hello Son! 
I see that old man, Hugo has finally sent you down into these roots. It's only going to get more 
dangerous down there, this tree holds all of the evils in the world and it's up to us to keep them at bay.
It seems that an enemy is blocking your way to the next level. Figure this one out, son!
Before you move on, I want you to know that I'm proud of you.
